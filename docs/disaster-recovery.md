To prepare for disaster recovery, iFood can take the following steps:

1. Create a disaster recovery plan: iFood should create a detailed plan that outlines the steps that need to be taken in case of a disaster,
such as a cyberattack, natural disaster, or any other unforeseen event. The plan should include key contacts, procedures, and protocols that
will be followed during the recovery process.

2. Implement backup systems: iFood should implement backup systems to ensure that critical data is not lost during a disaster. Backups should be 
stored off-site and regularly tested to ensure they are working correctly.

3. Conduct regular risk assessments: iFood should conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats to their systems.
This will allow them to take proactive measures to mitigate these risks before a disaster occurs.

4. Train employees: iFood should train its employees on disaster recovery procedures and protocols to ensure that everyone is prepared and knows what 
to do in case of an emergency.

5. Test the plan: iFood should regularly test its disaster recovery plan to ensure that it is effective and up-to-date.
This will allow them to identify any weaknesses in the plan and make necessary adjustments before a disaster occurs.

6. Cybersecurity measures: iFood could implement cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems to prevent
and mitigate cyber attacks. In case of a security breach, iFood could follow incident response protocols to minimize the damage and restore the system.

By taking these steps, iFood can ensure that it is well-prepared to handle any disaster and can recover quickly and efficiently.
